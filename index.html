    <p> This website is for you, nature, and your nature</p>
    <p> Life is increasingly becoming more distanced from nature. We have 
        peloton bikes, surround sound systems, virtual reality, Pokemon Go, that makes us <em> feel </em>
        like we are outside, but we aren't getting the full effects of nature.
        This website is here to make life, getting into nature, and preserving nature a little easier.
